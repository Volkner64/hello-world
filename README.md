Hello world!

Gio here, I am just commencing the start of my technological career.
I am excited to be a member of the GitHub community because of all the helpful resources at hand.
I love anime, music, and video games. I am also in love with the technological capabilities Teslas have.
I wish to learn as much as I can about computer science and software programming.
